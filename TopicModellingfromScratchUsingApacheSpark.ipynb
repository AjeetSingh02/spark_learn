Doing 130 to 150 aint a rush for me, but its fun and I get where I want to go much faster.  In defense of the drivers, who are in the right lane. Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph. I dont think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rearview ALWAYS calculate future positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential. Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit.

Both my pastors late model Corolla and my fathers 1987 Stanza have demonstrated the \"falling door seals\" problem.  As unfair as it may seem, the difference between Chrysler and Toyota is that Chrysler needs to prove that it can build quality cars. Toyota can afford make a few small mistakes without hurting the image.

That is why lowabiding citizens should have  the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary  anywhere a threat is imminent.

On another occasion, on my way from Texas to Florida, I had stopped in a small motel  for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida. About 5 youths were disturbing my  car, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenant  walked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished.  Needless to say, I immediately packedup and left.   Watch out for carjacking and staged accidents. They can be deadly!

Contrary to popular misperception, a | number of Japanese cars have quite good performance from 70+ in top | gear.  No problem with that. The question is do they perform consistently in all conditions (roads, winds and curves) at that speed and do so for hours on end, year after year without giving the driver white knuckles? From my experience on the Autobahns/Autostrade, a good touring car can be easily distinguished by its \"poise\" at 100mph. The best stay on cruise control at 155 for hours. Ive seen the typical boy racer in a Fiat try to keep up. Sure they hit the century mark, but if the wind blows the wrong way they change lanes, and if on an overpass, they may fly right into a guardrail. The buffeting at 125 can be severe enough to make the hood bend. Tires at 155 can melt, and a pothole can kill. Many German cars are designed for this environment, even if they cant seem to get out of their own way from a stop light (Mercedes come to mind in particular.) And another design point is fuel economy at those speeds.

To me, the question really is not about dealer profit but the  amount of money for the type of car.

OK, I know its a 92 model, but I think  I got a better car (though I have to adjust my initial idea of  why I am getting a new car).   Today, during a conversion with a friend, I learned he rejected  a Saturn for a Ford Tarurs; as it only costed him a little bit more  than a SL2. I may be wrong, but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL2. I agree that a fullyloaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWEREND Ford Taurus. A FULLYLOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2. A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000$23,000 range. A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000. Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000 if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan.

Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things area The part about spending $50007000 on repairs reminds me of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that. The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period. That was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry. Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs. Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus. That is ridiculous. Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.

I am fairly sure that placement of the steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time.....  By the 1920s, there was a very active \"good roads\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense. Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside. This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind  Warren Belasco \"America on the Road\" (title may not be exact  author is) and another called \"The Devil Wagon in Gods Country\" author I forget.

The design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM. The idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM. The secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used. The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable. This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation. The case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 RX7! The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated. Since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers use of the car. I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM. While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars. I personally wouldnt mind the dealer collecting my driving demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>212</td></tr><tr><td>In article (\"Erik Velapoldi\") writes This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway.

Watch out for folks standing NEXT to the road or on overpasses. They can cause SERIOUS HARM to you and your car.  (just a cliffnotes version of my story follows)  10pm last night, I was travelling on the interstate here in knoxville, I was taking an offramp exit to another interstate and my wife suddenly screamed and something LARGE hit the side of my truck. We slowed down, but after looking back to see the vandals standing there, we drove on to the police station.  She did get a good look at the guy and saw him \"cock his arm\" with something the size of a cinderblock, BUT I never saw him. We are VERY lucky the truck sits up high on the road; if it would have hit her window, it would have killed her.  The police are looking for the guy, but in all likelyhood he is gone. Stuff deleted... I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the freeway. Several persons were killed when said blocks came through their windshields. Many overpass bridges are now fenced, and they have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges (as if that would stop such people). Yet many bridges are NOT fenced. I always look up at a bridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this *sport* has not reached us here in Fresno. ___________________________________________________________________ Photojournalism sequence, Department of Journalism CSU Fresno, Fresno, CA 93740 </td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>248</td></tr><tr><td>In article (Robert Neilson) writes [sorry for the 0 auto content, but ... ]   That is why lowabiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves  and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is  imminent.

I am an infrequent reader of rec.autos, so I cant remember).  I am in the market for a used Chevy Suburban, and have observed that prices for models with diesel engines run about $10002000 less than comparable models with a gas engine.  There has to be a reason for this.  Yes, there is consumer confusion. In the early 80s with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage. Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines. So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter). Big mistake. The engine was not redesigned, but converted. The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc. Lots of problems with these cars. This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer  DON\"T BUY A DIESEL. THEY ARE BAD. This was a gross generalization. Ask yourself this question  if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle? What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks? Even Train Locomotives? Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.

It goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door frame. Surely it would come off easily. Lack of build quality was the thing I notced on the first 2 LHs I saw months back. The panel gaps were large and nonuniform between the 2 cars I saw  the kind of thing you expect and accept on a Mustang  but not from Chryslers savior.

What kind of memory is stable/reliable enough, nonvolatile enough and independent enough (of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of a vehicle? Im amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).  MK48T02 from thomsom. It has a timekeeper (clock) and 512 bytes of NVRAM which has a lithium battery backup. The battery has a life of ~10 years of poweroff operation. Installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not draw much current. The battery would only be used when your auto battery was dead or had been removed. Side question how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K actual miles. Looks like fraud would be fairly easy  for the price of a new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has.</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>302</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer Reports once wrote about the S10 Blazer that it \"shook and rattled like a tired taxi cab\".

The outcome was decidedly mixed. I won the battle but lost the war. The arbitrator found that the car was defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value (. At the time of the hearing, average retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but the decision was for $17,665. I wrote a letter to the Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you. There is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase. The attitude of Chevrolets representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view; he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously. I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am getting totally screwed on the price. I will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on the Idaho lemon law.

Thats a ridiculous comparison, I know, but the point is that Saturns (and highend Civics, for that matter) accelerate just fine, in fact better than most unimproved \"muscle\" cars of the 60s; 300 hp is great, but tied to 2 tons, it just doesnt go that quick. Saturns, on the other hand, use 125 hp tied to 2400 lbs with some short gearing to move very quickly off the line. Anyway....    While your 060 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, I saw the PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds. Im sure that most SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still astonishingly fast for a small 4door. A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds 060, if Im not mistaken.

Ive done my clutch and miscellaneous little engine fixes.  The hardest part is usually getting the darned thing off the intake manifold. Rebuilding a carb is fun, if youre into things with lots of little parts. I used to rebuild them for all my friends cars in high school, so it doesnt take a PhD. Buy a carb rebuilding kit from an auto supply store. Buy a gallon of the best carb cleaning solvent you can find (do they still make Tyme?)  as a rule of thumb, buy the one with the scariest warning labels. Put it into a metal(!) bucket. Make yourself a dipping can by punching holes in the bottom of a coffee can and attaching a wire handle to it. If the carb cleaner doesnt strip the paint right off the coffee can, youre not using the right stuff. Use the can to soak the little stuff, and just hang the big parts from a coat hanger. Wash them off with a garden hose, wipe off excess water with paper towels, and air dry. Then remember where all the little parts go. Follow the rebuild kits instructions concerning float height, choke tension, etc. Bolt it back on the engine and admire the superclean carb on the filthy engine. Heed this mans warnings!

When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was their problem, I wasnt giving them any more money. The finance guy then brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I reminded him that I was the customer and I didnt think I should be treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole deal.

What makes me upset is that R12 costs are skyrocketing and in fact cant be bought anymore in my area. Also this is yet another way mechanics and dealers can RIPOFF customers. Also I was reading that the new refrigerant is not compatible with the r12 system and that it would cost $ 300 upto a $ 1000 to retrofit a car with the old R12 system. ALthough it is important to consider the environment I think the sudden ban is a slap in the face for the consumer. Why is it that the consumer should have to pay for the retrofit? The auto companies should have seen this coming? Also why is it that the governments of the world were so quick in banning freon use and yet so slow in banning gasoline. In my opinion gasoline is just as hazardous as anything else. Why cant they start proposing bans on this and switch to natural gas or electric? The technology is there. Hopefully some chemist will come up with another alternative coolant that will be compatible with the old system. Al H. Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for R12. You dont hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society (MACS), that is, the people who stand to rake in that $300 to $1000 per retrofit per automobile, have mounted an organized campaign to squash those R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether (on very shaky technical grounds, at best, on outright lies at worst).</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>506</td></tr><tr><td>(David .

If you cant pull it because things are in the way, push it with an open hand. I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face. After coming to, which is about 15 minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain.

That is not to say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick (eg disabled persons), but they arent in any position to use an SHO anyway.  I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all \"performancetype\" cars (like the 5.0l Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) wed cut down on the number of accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans, but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO.   James  I have to disagree with this. I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4speed auto w/ overdrive, and it is really better that way. Chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power. I live in the Dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic here. Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to, a manual would be more fun. Safetywise, an auto is less distracting...I would hate to have to be shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here. Performancewise, I can hold my own against any stock 5.0 Mustang or 5.0 Camaro w/ a five speed. </td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>522</td></tr><tr><td>Here is a story.

In between 91 and 92, the instrument pannel of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset to zero.

Ramanathan) writes  The part about spending $50007000 on repairs reminds me of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that. The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period. That was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.   Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs. Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus. That is ridiculous. Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things. I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more in repair costs. did you account for depreciation? i seriously doubt that a taurus would rack up an extra $4000 in repair costs over 5 years.</td><td>7</td><td>rec.autos</td><td>524</td></tr><tr><td> I have a 1982 Regal and I am interested in buying a fiberglass hood, trunk, and bumpers for it.

This results in silent corruption  of data when used with some devices, including ultramodern devices.  Although I will not name the devices, since it is not their fault, an  example would be a Sony 3.5 inch MO, without the special \"Maccompatible\"  firmware installed. One solution, sometimes, is to disable \"blind writes\"  To the best of my knowledge there arent any problems with Quadras and blind transfers. Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didnt test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of 16µsec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \"hiccup\" in the middle of blocks. If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going. In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync. Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didnt pay attention to the errors coming back. Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager. The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasnt been clocked yet. Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesnt crash the machine...</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td><td>655</td></tr><tr><td>(Brian V.

I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe). It is a 3.5\" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC and just recently was released for the Mac world (dont ask me what the differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production. I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouses PowerUser. The PLI and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives. Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more reliable.

So far no responsed that  Ive noticed. Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade  paths Cost, efficiency, pros/cons, etc.. Thanks!   Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent  copy of MacWorld or MacUser. My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant  comparison factors visavis a IIci are as follows   25 MHz 68040  16 Mhz data path (dont recall this for sure, but its slower  than Q 950 style machines for sure).  Ethertalk card onboard  Audio in/out  4 MB RAM on motherboard  4 SIMM slots  2 NuBus slots.  More flexible buildin video than the CI. Uses VRAM.   In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator wont give you  audio or ethernet or the same video options.  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I  think it ends up costing more.   Greg Dudek Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz). The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer). However the Q700 upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\" with 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM). It also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td><td>699</td></tr><tr><td> Hi there!

I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were seeded with PowerPCs on a NuBus card.  Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed?

Since there  were so many mails about problems with this board, my questions  does the board work with 7.1 and A/UX 3.0 ? Does anybody know problems  with any kind of software ?   Well, I havent seen any reports of problems with the Turbo 040,  but to my knowledge, Daystar has not released a version of the  board that works with anything but the IIsi and IIci, and they  have not finished tweaking/testing for use with A/UX. This may  not happen until the A/UX 3.0.2 upgrade is released (my guess) so  Id recommend waiting or buying the 50 MHz 030 board and upgrade  later when A/UX compatibility is assured. Turbo 040 interface  cards for the II, IIx, SE/30, IIcx, etc will probably be available  sooner, but if A/UX compatibility is a requirement, it is probably  best to be patient and let someone else be the pioneer. ;) An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE/30 is that, just as with the 030 power cache, the 040 accelerator will plug into the CPU socket, leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet card.

In all Mac price lists Ive seen, every C650 has the message \"fpu optional\". I know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80 configuration. Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list? Im planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but Im now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not. Why say \"optional\" if its built in? Please, anybody help me understand this game.  Regards,  Thian.  If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with a 68RC040 processor that has builtin math coprocessor support. My understanding is that the \"optional fpu\" refers to your option of purchasing the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU. Apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonFPU system to become an FPU system. And, it is unclear whether the 040 processor on the nonFPU system (a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor. Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY comes with a nonFPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU  the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot swap one for another (again, according to Apples memo).</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td><td>813</td></tr><tr><td>In article (Edward M.

But I am quite sure that the Macintosh uses the full 16bit or 32bit data path to its full advantage. That is, it is running as fast with two or four 30pin SIMMs as it would with one 72pin SIMM. Now, it may be that longword accesses (assuming a 32bit data path here) get the first byte from the first SIMM, the second byte from the second, and so on. This would mean that each longword of memory is actually split among four SIMMs, one for each byte. On the other hand, it could be that the SIMMs are interleaved by word or longword (not just by byte), or they could be successive in memory, and the memory controller deals with the eightbit data path that each one has. I suspect, though, that they are interleaved to some extent so that 32 bits can be read or written at once. This would indicate a bytelevel interleave.  I am NOT confusing this with the new machines longword interleave with two 72pin SIMMs of the same sort, although that seems to be the same sort of idea. There, you get an essential 64bit data path ro (excuse me, to) RAM instead of just a 32bit one. Yes, the CPU cant handle it, but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something up.  So, Dale, am I right? 30pin SIMMs are interleaved by bytes, allowing the full data bus? Or, as is common with Usenet and me in particular, am I as clueless as everyone else? What conclusion can be drawn from this? Im trying to figure out what kind of memory configuration for the LC III (32bit datapath) would be fastest.

Yes (2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 running at 15.87 Mhz. (3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a lot of memory. (4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options Some vendors sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB  $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here. (5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP3045 40 MB HD with an average access time of about 25 ms. (6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or nonbacklit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read. Other things to consider  Where to get the portable and how much to pay for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to sell a 2MB Nonbacklit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $650.

The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in effect until May.

Its great, but Im still having some problems figuring out what strings to use in what applications. I basically need strings for Zterm, FirstClass client, and Telefinder client. Ive been able to get FirstClass and Zterm working by using another modems settings in FirstClass and copying them for Zterm. However, it still has problems  Zterm, for example, will list ERROR the first time I try dialing after starting the problem. If I cancel and try again, it works fine. Telefinder is even worse  I cant get it to even wake up the modem. So, if anyone uses a ZyXEL for any of these programs, Id greatly appreciate you sending me the setup strings you use Thanks in advance! writes For zterm, I initially did the following atz4 at&d0 at&w0 Then I set my init string to atz0. Thats it! (Rod Smith) writes I cant help you with FirstClass or Telefinder, but Ive been using ZTerm and a ZyXEL for close to two weeks now. Heres what I did  Once in ZTerm, set hardware handshaking on and the bps rate to 57,600. (Youve probably already done this.) Then I typed  at&d0 at&w  The first line sets the modem to ignore the DTR line (necessary for hardware handshaking with most, though not all, Mac hardware handshaking cables). The second stores this setting in nonvolatile memory in the modem, so its the default when the modem starts. In the modem preferences dialog, I have the modem initialization string set to \"at&z0^M\", which just insures that the stored setting is used (useful if starting ZTerm after using something like the fax software or MacWoof, which change the settings in other ways). Alternatively, you could leave the factory default the way it is and just set the ZTerm initialization string to \"at&d0^M\", which would accomplish the same thing IF the modem is always on before you start ZTerm, and IF other programs dont modify the settings. Or \"at&z0&d0^M\" would work even if other programs modify the modems settings. I do it the way I do because I sometimes forget to turn on the modem before launching ZTerm, and this way Im assured of having the correct DTR handling when the modems powered up. After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I came up with ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M This is entered in the Initialize box on the Modem Preferences in Zterm. Quick summary of each commmand Z0  Reset modem to User Profile 0. L2  Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet) N2  Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet) X5  Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual) &D0  Assume DTR (computer) is always on S11=50  Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle) In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right before the S11 command, in the setup box. This disables the autoanswer function of the modem for FirstClass. I based my modem setting on the Supra 14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td><td>873</td></tr><tr><td>Were about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers.

Although NiCad (145,145,160,165c,170,180) batteries should be completely   discharged about once a month, LeadAcid batteries (100) shouldnt ever be   completely discharged (well, maybe ONCE in a while is OKAY).    This is a very common misconception dealing with Nicad batteries. It is  a good idea to completely discharge a nicad CELL periodically. It is  NOT a good idea to completely discharge a nicad BATTERY. The difference  being that a cell is only one cell (nicad puts out 1.2 volts) like a  rechargeable AAA, AA, C, or D. A battery is defined as more than one  cell (9 volt, or 7.2 for nicad equivalent). Due to differences in the  individual cells of a battery, complete discharge can actually harm  a nicad battery more than help it overcome the \"memory effect\". The  most common problem is that over time an individual cell can develop  internal shorts, which will weaken other cells that are connected to  it, thus reducing the lifespan of your battery pack.  etc....

(Sorry for length). To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a staticfree work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on. 1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case. 2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables, spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out. 3. Remove the flopy drive. 4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting the supply straight up and out. 5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom side of the fan and lifting straight up and out. 6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and right side of the board and sliding the board forward then lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the board must be removed first) 7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules). This is not easy even for a skilled solderer. 8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers. 9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder them in. 10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock. 11.Put large power transistor heat sinks on the processor chip and the other large chip just to the right of the processor and figure some way to hold the heat syncs in place. I made a simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat syncs to hold them in place.

If there were a problem with the Quad 900s and PB 170s, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo? If there isnt a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers (like Spectre, etc. do)?  Quadra 900s and PowerBook 170s have the same ROMS (to my knowledge), so maybe this is a ROM problem? (if so, though, why wouldnt System 7.1 patch over this problem?)     Thanks for any help you can provide! In article Jon Wtte, writes Mac sound hardware is diverse; some macs play in stereo and mix the output (the SE/30 for instance) while others play in stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker, while some are \"truly\" mono (like the LC)  Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is guaranteed to be heard, while the right channel isnt.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Macbased systems.

I am working on a project for my marketing class and Id like to ask your help. The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it. Technical issues are not terribly important at this point. Well, my groups plan is to market a \"full page\" monitor for laptop computers. It would be a thirdparty product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technologys PaletteBook screen). The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!). In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people. Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document. Because of the target users and applications, color screens arent really a neccessity. We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000. Now, please dont write this off as completely ridiculous. I really need some constructive feedback. So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know 1.

The NeXT is connected  to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.   Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT,  and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.   What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that  will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT  via the Ethernet Mac.

No big deal, but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldnt come up! The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine. Ive heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get it swapped. I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft poweron/off. This wasnt mentioned in any of the literature I saw. Also, the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful. Having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient. Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on powerup. Ive seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature... Anyway, above all, its fast. A great machine at a great price!</td><td>4</td><td>comp.sys.mac.hardware</td><td>1095</td></tr><tr><td>wouldany one know afair price for an LC Color card in Aussie dollars?? just wondering... *************************************************************************** The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.
